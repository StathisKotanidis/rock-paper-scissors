A rock-paper-scissors game made with HTML,CSS and JavaScript.This is my solution to The Odin's Project rock-paper-scissors section.It was the first time that i actually combined all these 3 technologies to create something!Learned a lot of things such as :
•DOM Methods (e.g querySelector())
•DOM Events (e.g addEventListener())
•Animating elements
•Using Callbacks
